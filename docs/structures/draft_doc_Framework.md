- **Scope**: Define the scope of the project, including its limitations and boundaries.
- **Architecture Overview**: Provide a high-level diagram or summary of the project architecture (e.g., microservices, client-server, or monolithic architecture).
- **Technologies Used**: List the primary technologies, frameworks, and tools used in the project.

## Installation and Setup

- **Prerequisites**: List prerequisites (e.g., versions of Node.js, MongoDB, Docker).

- **Installation Steps:**

  - Step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and dependencies.
  - Include configuration steps for environment variables, database connections, and third-party services.

- **Running the Application:**

  - Commands and steps to start the application locally.
  - Additional setup for running in different environments (development, production).

## 3. Coding Standards and Best Practices

- **Folder Structure**: Document the folder structure with descriptions of each directory and its purpose.
- **Naming Conventions**: Define naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
- **Code Formatting**: Specify the code style (e.g., Prettier, ESLint rules) and provide configuration details if applicable.
- **Commenting Guidelines**:
  - Use JSDoc or TypeDoc format for documenting functions and classes.
  - Instructions for commenting complex logic and code sections.
- **Error Handling**: Describe standard practices for error handling, including how errors should be thrown and managed.

## 4. API Documentation

- **Introduction**: Overview of the API, its purpose, and how to authenticate.
- **Endpoints**:

  - List all endpoints, grouped by functionality (e.g., User Management, Role Management).
  - For each endpoint, include:
    - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - URL path
    - Request parameters (path, query, body parameters) with types and descriptions
    - Response structure, including sample responses
    - Error codes and handling instructions
  - Authentication and Authorization:
    - Detail the authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
    - Describe role-based or permission-based access if applicable.

## 5. Database Structure

- **Schema Documentation:**
  - List each database schema with fields, types, and brief descriptions.
  - Provide sample documents for each schema if helpful.
- Relationships and Associations:
  - Describe relationships between schemas or tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
  - Include diagrams or visual aids to illustrate relationships.

## 6. Service Documentation

- **Service Overview:**
  - Brief description of each service (e.g., UserService, RoleService).
  - Define the purpose and scope of each service.
- **Core Functions:**
  - List the primary functions for each service, their parameters, and expected behavior.
  - Include sample function calls and expected outputs.

## 7. Testing and Debugging

- **Test Strategy:**
  - Define the types of tests used (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, E2E).
  - Mention any testing frameworks used (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
- **How to Run Tests:**
  - Provide commands and configuration for running tests.
- **Debugging Tips:**
  - Offer tips for debugging common issues and provide tools (e.g., using Chrome DevTools, Postman).

## 8. Deployment and CI/CD

- Deployment Instructions:
  - Steps for deploying to various environments.
  - Include setup for infrastructure, if applicable (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
  - Explain CI/CD setup, including tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
  - Describe the pipeline and key stages (e.g., testing, building, deploying).

## 9. Glossary and FAQs

- **Glossary**: Define technical terms and abbreviations used throughout the documentation.
- **FAQs**: Answer common questions that may arise during development or use of the application.

# Instructions for Coding

- **1. Understand Requirements Thoroughly:** Before you start coding, ensure all functional requirements and user stories are clear. Break down tasks into small, manageable pieces.

- **2. Follow Coding Standards:**

  - Stick to the naming conventions, formatting rules, and best practices defined in the project.

  - Write modular, reusable code where possible.

- **3. Document Your Code:**

  - Use comments to explain the purpose of complex sections, especially where logic isn’t self-explanatory.

  - Use JSDoc or similar formats for function definitions and classes.

- **4. Error Handling:**

  - Handle exceptions gracefully with try-catch blocks.

  - Log errors for debugging, and throw meaningful error messages where applicable.

- **5. Write Tests as You Go:**

  - Write unit tests for each function to ensure isolated functionality works as expected.

  - Use mocks or stubs where needed to simulate external dependencies.

- **6. Optimize for Performance and Readability:**

  - Choose efficient algorithms and data structures where needed, especially for high-frequency operations.

  - Avoid premature optimization; focus on readability, then profile and optimize bottlenecks.

- **7. Version Control:**

  - Commit code regularly with meaningful commit messages.

  - Use branching strategies that align with your team’s workflow (e.g., Git Flow).

- **8. Code Reviews:**

  - Review your own code before submitting it for peer review.

  - Be open to feedback, and follow through on suggested improvements.

- **9. Deployment-Ready Code:**

  - Ensure environment-specific settings are in configuration files, not hard-coded.

  - Verify that code functions as expected in a staging environment before production deployment.

- 9. Refactoring and Cleanup:

  - Regularly review and refactor your code to improve readability and maintainability.
  -
  - Remove any debug logs or unused code before final commits.
